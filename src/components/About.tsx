      <Typography variant="subheading" component="p" paragraph={true}>
        We have observed in the last years that many companies have been putting technology to service for education, but always with a focus on students or on School Administration, but a key group is not being helped enough: Us teachers!
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="subheading" component="p" paragraph={true}>
        Instanteach wishes to balance the field and provide a time-saving and class-improving service free for all teachers! But of course, if you wish to support this project, you can do so through here.

          I'm Conrad, I studied Economics and International Development. I have always been fascinated by business, technology and education. I moved to Mexico in 2015 and started to work as a coordinator in a language school. Then I decided to work independently and ever since I have been teaching to private students as well as business classes in companies. My preferred way of teaching would comprehensible input and material personalization. Feel free to contact me for a question or just a general chat 😃
